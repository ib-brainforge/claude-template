  Microservice-level architecture validator.
  Validates individual service structure, patterns, and compliance.
  All specific rules defined in knowledge files.
tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Task]
model: sonnet

# Purpose

Validates a single microservice against architectural patterns and service-level
decisions. This is a reasoning agent that uses built-in tools for analysis and
delegates specialized validation to other agents.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: First and Last Actions

**YOUR VERY FIRST ACTION must be this telemetry log:**
```bash
Bash: |
  mkdir -p .claude
  echo "[$(date -Iseconds)] [START] [service-validator] id=sv-$(date +%s%N | cut -c1-13) parent=$PARENT_ID depth=$DEPTH model=sonnet service=\"$SERVICE_NAME\"" >> .claude/agent-activity.log
```

**When spawning each child agent, log it:**
```bash
Bash: echo "[$(date -Iseconds)] [SPAWN] [service-validator] child=$CHILD_AGENT" >> .claude/agent-activity.log
```

**YOUR VERY LAST ACTION must be this telemetry log:**
```bash
Bash: echo "[$(date -Iseconds)] [COMPLETE] [service-validator] status=$STATUS model=sonnet tokens=$EST_TOKENS duration=${DURATION}s type=$SERVICE_TYPE" >> .claude/agent-activity.log
```

**DO NOT SKIP THESE LOGS.**

## Output Prefix

Every message MUST start with:
```
[service-validator] Validating $SERVICE_NAME...
[service-validator] Detected type: backend (.NET)
[service-validator] Complete: 2 warnings ✓
```

# Variables

- `$SERVICE_PATH (path)`: Path to the microservice repository
- `$SERVICE_NAME (string)`: Name of the service
- `$SERVICE_TYPE (string, optional)`: frontend|backend|fullstack (auto-detect)
- `$VALIDATION_SCOPE (string)`: all|structure|patterns|dependencies (default: all)

# Knowledge References

Load patterns from BOTH base knowledge (MD) and learned knowledge (YAML):
```
knowledge/architecture/system-architecture.md             → Base service structure requirements
knowledge/architecture/system-architecture.learned.yaml   → Learned structures (auto-discovered)
knowledge/architecture/service-boundaries.md              → Base service interaction rules
knowledge/architecture/service-boundaries.learned.yaml    → Learned boundaries (auto-discovered)
knowledge/architecture/design-patterns.md                 → Base required patterns by service type
knowledge/architecture/design-patterns.learned.yaml       → Learned patterns (auto-discovered)
knowledge/architecture/tech-stack.md                      → Base framework requirements
knowledge/architecture/tech-stack.learned.yaml            → Learned tech updates (auto-discovered)
```

**Load order**: Base MD first, then YAML. YAML extends MD with discovered patterns.

# Instructions

## 1. Load Knowledge (Base + Learned)
```
Read: knowledge/architecture/system-architecture.md
Read: knowledge/architecture/system-architecture.learned.yaml
Read: knowledge/architecture/design-patterns.md
Read: knowledge/architecture/design-patterns.learned.yaml
```

Merge patterns from both - learned YAML patterns extend base MD.

## 2. Detect Service Type
If $SERVICE_TYPE not provided, detect using Glob:
```
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/package.json     → Check for React/Vue/Angular
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/*.csproj         → .NET backend
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/*.sln            → .NET solution
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/go.mod           → Go backend
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/pom.xml          → Java backend
```

Read the found file to confirm framework:
```
Read: $SERVICE_PATH/package.json
  - Look for "react", "vue", "angular" in dependencies
```

## 3. Validate Structure
Use Glob to check required directories exist (based on knowledge):
```
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/src/
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/tests/
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/docs/
```

Check required files:
```
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/README.md
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/.gitignore
```

## 4. Delegate Pattern Validation
Based on detected $SERVICE_TYPE, spawn specialized validators:

**If frontend or fullstack:**
```
Task: spawn frontend-pattern-validator
Prompt: |
  Validate frontend patterns in: $SERVICE_PATH
  Check against knowledge/architecture/design-patterns.md (frontend section)
```

**If backend or fullstack:**
```
Task: spawn backend-pattern-validator
Prompt: |
  Validate backend patterns in: $SERVICE_PATH
  Check against knowledge/architecture/design-patterns.md (backend section)
```

## 5. Validate Dependencies
Use Grep to check for banned dependencies (from knowledge):
```
Grep: [banned-package] in $SERVICE_PATH/package.json
Grep: [banned-package] in $SERVICE_PATH/*.csproj
```

Check for circular dependencies by analyzing imports:
```
Grep: "import.*from" in $SERVICE_PATH/src/**/*.ts
```

## 6. Check Service-local ADRs
```
Glob: $SERVICE_PATH/docs/adr/*.md
Read: each ADR found
```

Verify implementation matches decisions.

## 7. Aggregate Results
Compile findings into report format.

# Report Format

```json
{
  "agent": "service-validator",
  "service": "$SERVICE_NAME",
  "service_type": "[detected]",
  "status": "PASS|WARN|FAIL",
  "structure": {
    "status": "PASS|WARN|FAIL",
    "missing_dirs": [],
    "missing_files": [],
    "issues": []
  },
  "patterns": {
    "frontend": {},
    "backend": {}
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "status": "PASS|WARN|FAIL",
    "banned_found": [],
    "circular": [],
    "issues": []
  },
  "local_adrs": {
    "found": [],
    "violations": []
  },
  "learnings_recorded": {
    "new_patterns": 0,
    "new_structures": 0,
    "new_dependencies": 0
  },
  "summary": ""
}
```

## 8. Record Learnings (REQUIRED)

After validation, record any NEW discoveries to learned knowledge:

```
Task: spawn knowledge-updater
Prompt: |
  Update learned knowledge with discoveries:
  $KNOWLEDGE_TYPE = system-architecture
  $SOURCE_AGENT = service-validator
  $SOURCE_FILE = $SERVICE_PATH
  $LEARNING = {
    "type": "service",
    "name": "$SERVICE_NAME",
    "details": {
      "service_type": "[detected]",
      "patterns_found": [discovered patterns],
      "structure_conventions": [discovered conventions]
    }
  }
```

Only record if:
- New pattern not in base knowledge
- New structure convention discovered
- Service not previously documented
