# Knowledge Base

This folder contains **domain-specific knowledge** for your project. When using this setup in a new project, you only need to update files in this folder.

## Structure

## File Purposes

### validation/
Focused grep patterns for validator agents. Each validator loads only what it needs.

| File | Used By | Contains |
|------|---------|----------|
| `backend-patterns.md` | backend-pattern-validator | Stack detection, API/DB/security patterns |
| `frontend-patterns.md` | frontend-pattern-validator | Framework detection, component patterns |
| `security-standards.md` | plan-validator | Auth, data protection, audit requirements |
| `validation-config.md` | validation-orchestrator | Levels, scopes, exclusions |

### architecture/
System design and high-level patterns (no grep patterns here).

| File | Used By | Contains |
|------|---------|----------|
| `system-architecture.md` | master-architect | Service map, data flows, ADRs |
| `service-boundaries.md` | plan-validator, master-architect | Service responsibilities |
| `design-patterns.md` | design-pattern-advisor | Pattern guidance, examples |
| `tech-stack.md` | all validators | Framework versions |

### packages/
Package management configuration.

| File | Used By | Contains |
|------|---------|----------|
| `core-packages.md` | validators, design-pattern-advisor | Shared package APIs |
| `package-config.md` | npm/nuget-package-manager | Registry URLs, package names |
| `repo-config.md` | commit-manager | Branch rules, commit prefixes |

## How Agents Load Knowledge

Each agent loads **only the file(s) it needs**:

```
backend-pattern-validator  →  validation/backend-patterns.md
frontend-pattern-validator →  validation/frontend-patterns.md
plan-validator             →  validation/security-standards.md
                              architecture/service-boundaries.md
validation-orchestrator    →  validation/validation-config.md
master-architect           →  architecture/system-architecture.md
commit-manager             →  commit-conventions.md
                              packages/repo-config.md
```

## Using in a New Project

1. Copy the entire `claude-code-setup/` folder
2. Update files in `knowledge/` for your project
3. Agents/skills work automatically with new knowledge

## Why This Structure?

**Focused files** = less context loaded = faster, more accurate agents

Each validator loads ~100 lines instead of 500+ lines of mixed content.
